# Hospitality Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

This repository presents a **Hospitality Analytics Dashboard** built with **Power BI** to analyze key performance metrics within the hospitality industry. The project focuses on transforming raw data into actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on critical metrics such as ADR (Average Daily Rate), Occupancy Rate, and RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room).

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to deliver an end-to-end data analytics solution for the hospitality sector by utilizing Power BIâ€™s advanced data modeling and visualization capabilities. The final dashboard offers a comprehensive view of revenue optimization, customer segmentation, and occupancy trends.

## Key Components

### 1. Stakeholder Engagement:
- Engaged with stakeholders to identify their analytical needs.
- Refined and gathered business requirements to ensure relevant insights were provided.

### 2. Data Collection & Preparation:
- Sourced data from multiple platforms (PMS, CRM, Marketing Analytics).
- Used Power Query for data cleaning, including handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating calculated columns.

### 3. Data Modeling:
- Designed a star schema for efficient querying and analysis.
- Created relationships between tables to analyze various facets like room types, customer demographics, and booking periods.

### 4. Key Metrics & KPIs:
- **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: Measures average income per paid occupied room.
- **Occupancy Rate**: The percentage of available rooms that are occupied during a time period.
- **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**: Combines room pricing and occupancy performance into a single metric.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Evaluates long-term value generated by each customer.
- **Booking Trends**: Highlights seasonal variations and booking patterns.

### 5. Dashboard Design:
- Developed interactive dashboards using data visualization best practices.
- Integrated features such as slicers, drill-throughs, and dynamic visuals for deep analysis.
- Focused on storytelling through data to make insights easily digestible.

## Insights and Recommendations

- **Revenue Optimization**: Analyzed pricing strategies and occupancy trends to improve revenue streams.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Provided actionable marketing insights based on customer demographics and seasonal trends.
- Delivered a walkthrough of the final dashboards to stakeholders, summarizing the findings and recommended business actions.
